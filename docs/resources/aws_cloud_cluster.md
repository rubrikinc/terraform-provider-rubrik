The `rubrik_aws_cloud_cluster` resource creates an AWS cloud cluster using RSC.

This resource creates a Rubrik Cloud Data Management (CDM) cluster with elastic storage
in AWS using the specified configuration. The cluster will be deployed with the specified
number of nodes, instance types, and network configuration.

~> **Note:** This resource creates actual AWS infrastructure. Destroying the
   resource will attempt to clean up the created resources, but manual cleanup
   may be required.

~> **Note:** The AWS account must be onboarded to RSC with the Server and Apps
   feature enabled before creating a cloud cluster.

~> **Note:** This resource requires **Terraform v1.11.0 or later** due to the use of write-only attributes for
   `admin_email` and `admin_password`.

~> **Note:** Cloud Cluster deletion is now supported. When destroying this resource,
   the cluster will be removed from RSC. If the cluster has blocking conditions
   (active SLAs, global SLAs, or RCV locations), the deletion will fail and you must
   resolve these conditions first. Use the 'force_cluster_delete_on_destroy' option
   to force removal when eligible.

The `rubrik_aws_cloud_cluster` resource creates an AWS cloud cluster using RSC.

This resource creates a Rubrik Cloud Data Management (CDM) cluster with elastic storage
in AWS using the specified configuration. The cluster will be deployed with the specified
number of nodes, instance types, and network configuration.

~> **Note:** This resource creates actual AWS infrastructure. Destroying the
   resource will attempt to clean up the created resources, but manual cleanup
   may be required.

~> **Note:** The AWS account must be onboarded to RSC with the Server and Apps

~> **Note:** This resource requires **Terraform v1.11.0 or later**. The `admin_email` and `admin_password` fields in
the `cluster_config` block use write-only attributes, which are only supported in Terraform v1.11.0 and later.

## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_config` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Configuration for the cloud cluster. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cluster_config))
- `region` (String) AWS region to deploy the cluster in. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `vm_config` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) VM configuration for the cluster nodes. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--vm_config))

### Optional
