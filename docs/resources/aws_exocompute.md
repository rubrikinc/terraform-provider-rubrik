The `rubrik_aws_exocompute` resource creates an RSC Exocompute configuration
for AWS workloads.

There are 3 types of Exocompute configurations:
 1. *RSC Managed Host* - When an RSC managed host configuration is created, RSC
    will automatically deploy the necessary resources in the specified AWS
    region to run the Exocompute service. AWS security groups can be managed by
    RSC or by the customer.
 2. *Customer Managed Host* - When a customer managed host configuration is
    created, RSC will not deploy any resources. Instead it will use the AWS EKS
    cluster attached by the customer, using the
    `rubrik_aws_exocompute_cluster_attachment` resource, for all operations.
 3. *Application* - An application configuration is created by mapping the
    application cloud account to a host cloud account. The application cloud
    account will leverage the Exocompute resources deployed for the host
    configuration.

Items 1 and 2 above requires that the AWS account has been onboarded with the
`EXOCOMPUTE` feature.

Since there are 3 types of Exocompute configurations, there are 3 ways to create
a `rubrik_aws_exocompute` resource:
 1. Using the `account_id`, `region`, `vpc_id` and `subnets` or `subnet` fields
    creates an RSC managed host configuration. Use the `subnet` block when pod
    subnets are needed. The `cluster_security_group_id` and
    `node_security_group_id` fields can be used to create an Exocompute
    configuration where the customer manage the security groups. The
    `cluster_access` field can be used to configure private EKS cluster access.
 2. Using the `account_id` and `region` fields creates a customer managed host
    configuration. Note, the `rubrik_aws_exocompute_cluster_attachment`
    resource must be used to attach an AWS EKS cluster to the Exocompute
    configuration.
 3. Using the `account_id` and `host_cloud_account_id` fields creates an
    application configuration.

-> **Note:** Customer managed Exocompute is sometimes referred to as Bring Your
   Own Kubernetes (BYOK). Using both host and application Exocompute
   configurations is sometimes referred to as shared Exocompute.

## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) RSC cloud account ID (UUID). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

### Optional

- `cluster_access` (String) EKS cluster access type. Possible values are `EKS_CLUSTER_ACCESS_TYPE_PUBLIC` and `EKS_CLUSTER_ACCESS_TYPE_PRIVATE`. Can only be used with RSC managed configurations. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `cluster_security_group_id` (String) AWS security group ID for the cluster. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `host_account_id` (String) Exocompute host cloud account ID. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `node_security_group_id` (String) AWS security group ID for the nodes. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `region` (String) AWS region to run the Exocompute instance in. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `subnet` (Block Set, Max: 2) AWS subnet for the cluster. Each subnet block accepts a `subnet_id` (Required) and an
  optional `pod_subnet_id`. Conflicts with `subnets`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
  - `subnet_id` (String, Required) AWS subnet ID.
  - `pod_subnet_id` (String, Optional) AWS subnet ID for the pods.
- `subnets` (Set of String) AWS subnet IDs for the cluster subnets. Conflicts with `subnet`. Changing this forces a new
  resource to be created.
- `vpc_id` (String) AWS VPC ID for the cluster network. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Exocompute configuration ID (UUID).
- `rubrik_managed` (Boolean) If true the security groups are managed by RSC.

## Import

To import an application exocompute configuration prepend `app-` to the ID of the configuration.

Import is supported using the following syntax:


In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = rubrik_aws_exocompute.host
  id = "58e2a8bb-078d-4f67-8b66-5515fd701c8e"
}
```



The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```terraform
% terraform import rubrik_aws_exocompute.host 58e2a8bb-078d-4f67-8b66-5515fd701c8e
```
