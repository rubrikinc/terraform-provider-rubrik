The `rubrik_user` data source is used to access information about an RSC user.
Information for both local and SSO users can be accessed. A user is looked up
using either the ID or the email address.

-> **Note:** RSC allows the same email address to be used, at the same time, by
   both local and SSO users. Use the `domain` field to specify in which domain
   to look for a user.

-> **Note:** The `status` field will always be `UNKNOWN` for SSO users.
